	* lib/Representable.cc (Represent): On Windows, use localtime_s
	instead of localtime.

	* lib/CommandLine.cc (Parse): Fixed parsing for arguments without
	flags. Pointer arithmetic for std::vector<std::string> does not
	work. Using const_iterator instead.

	* Restructured visa project to allow code sharing between
	different tools. Imported directory structure into Visual Studio
	2010 and started git version control.
