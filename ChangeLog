	* src/agilent33410A/agilent33410A.cc (ErrorOccurred): Switched to
	ReadStatusByte function.

	* lib/Visa.cc (SetTimeout): Added separate function to change
	current timeout value. Cache current timeout and only call the
	library function if actually different.

	* lib/Visa.cc (Trigger): Added wrapper around viAssertTrigger
	function for software triggers.

	* lib/Visa.cc (ReadStatusByte): Added wrapper around viReadSTB
	function.

	* SConstruct: Initial support for building under OSX using the
	VISA 32-bit framework.

	* lib/Representable.cc (Represent): On Windows, use localtime_s
	instead of localtime.

	* lib/CommandLine.cc (Parse): Fixed parsing for arguments without
	flags. Pointer arithmetic for std::vector<std::string> does not
	work. Using const_iterator instead.

	* Restructured visa project to allow code sharing between
	different tools. Imported directory structure into Visual Studio
	2010 and started git version control.
